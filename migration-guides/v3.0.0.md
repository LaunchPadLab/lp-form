## v3.0.0 Migration Guide

There's only one breaking change in this version- a difference in the way errors are wrapped in `SubmissionError` objects. Now, instead of looking for a `response.errors` attribute and passing that to `SubmissionError`, the wrapping function looks for an `errors` attribute. This means that if you're using `lp-form` with `lp-requests`, you'll have to upgrade `lp-requests` to `>=3.0.0` in order to get error handling to work properly.
